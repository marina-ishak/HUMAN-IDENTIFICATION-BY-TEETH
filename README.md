I employed moment invariants for individual images and calculated the Euclidean
distance between different images as a means of distinguishing between various
teeth images. This method was utilized in an image test to determine whether it
corresponds to the correct individual. The results were evaluated through the
creation of a confusion matrix to assess accuracy.
